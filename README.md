Please read Movie Maniac Documentation.pdf in the files for documentation.

This project is based on PHP, Javascript and PostgreSQL.

You can use the files in the SQL directory expect for queries.sql. Every file creates a table. You need to change the 
URL in globals.php and also database access in functions.php. 

Also setup the database with name movie_maniac. You need to setup database on PostgreSQL.
